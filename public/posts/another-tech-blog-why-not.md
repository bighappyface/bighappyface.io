Hello world :P

My name is David Porter and I am a father, husband, and occasionally at some point during the week, a software developer focused on web applications.

This blog is nothing special, just a place for me to post (hopefully) helpful information on web and software-related topics. My goal is to provide useful proof-of-concepts, neat tips, and lots of code samples in either GitHub repos or Gists. I may have some posts voicing my thoughts and philosophy on various work and development practices, but I expect them to be few and far between.

You can find me online on [https://github.com/bighappyface](GitHub), [https://twitter.com/bighappyface](Twitter), and [https://www.facebook.com/david.porter.5667901](Facebook), and all comments (as well as PRs) are welcome.

Cheers,

David
