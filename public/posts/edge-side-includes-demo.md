## Hey there!

I recently came across a production reason to use Edge Side Includes in Varnish, and I'm pretty happy with the outcome.

To help introduce folks to ESI and the possibilities it provides, I have created a simple demo repo showcasing some practical uses:

Check it out and tell me what you think!

I'm going to discuss this in person for the Feb 2016 meetup of the SA Web Dev group:Â http://www.meetup.com/sawebdev/events/228290389/

See you there!
